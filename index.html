            For this group project, the focus was to select a startup from YCombinator and create a Figma prototype of our
            interpretation of what the startup should include in their app. This was to practice the process of moving 
            from the concept stage to implementing a prototype of the product. We were not allowed to look at the company's 
            current interface in coming up with our design. There were three stages to the project:

                <br>

        </div>
        

        <p class = "mainText"> 
           After we successfully went through these stages, we incorporated the user feedback we recieved and reached out to 
           the startup with our revised designs through email and asked for their feedback. <br><br><br>

                    commercial real estate has never been greater as 60% of the Fortune 500 have issued climate pledges and 50 municipalities
                     have mandated building emissions reductions. We help our customers measure the carbon footprint of their

        </h1>

        <p class = "intro">
            The first stage of the project was to do sketches. We all brainstormed basic ideas of how 
            we each would implement the interface and drew up basic sketches of how we thought the interface should look like.

    <div class = "intro">
        Design Decisions: <br> 
        We decided as a group that there still needed to be some more interactive visuals that told users more about the data in comparison to others. 
        We felt that for each subcategory we needed an associate graph or table to show data in relations to others. We also wanted to make navigating through this site easier
        if there were many buildings being used. A final idea that we had was a good Summary page, since often times the managers wouldn't need too in depth data unless there was a problem
        but rather a 'Summary' page to inform them that everything is normal. For these reasonse we had small blocks representing any data on usage of differnet utilities and
        made sure that there were options for mulitple buildings. We also added a tips page as this could be a customizable set of tips that Cambio can provide based on the 
        building data.

            </h1>
            <p class = "intro">Next we decided to incorporate elements from all our sketches into a more furnished
                mockup called a wireframe. We layed out the basic ui elements of the app and started to plan for the more polished
                figma version.

            HI-FI Prototype

        <p class = "intro">Next, we used Figma to come up with an interactive prototype that could accept user input 
            such as touch. We created 6 pages for our app that were linked together and represented our version of what
            we believed the app should look like.

           <br><br> After we made our first version of the prototype, we conducted a test to obtain user feedback and improve the design. 
            We presented our design to our classmates and they interacted with the prototype for a few minutes. Down below is a list of the 
            suggestions that were made:<br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be clear about color distinctions (ex. red if some tenants are using substantially higher usage compared to other tenants)</li>
            <li>The summary page is pushed towards the bottom but data from the summary page could be put into graphs or charts on the home page</li>
            <li>Switch up the fonts (currently only one font throughout)</li>
            <li>“Book Here”/“Consultation” should be on the home page or more showcased than at the bottom of the summary page</li>
            <li>Perhaps the summary page should even be the main page</li>
            <li>Group all of the data related to different components to show the cost vs emissions data in one spot</li>
            <li>On iPhone/tablet - size wise boxes are too small (specifically on the summary page)</li>
            <li>Introduce different information between the summary and home pages</li>
            <li>Cost Analysis button could be a different shape to distinguish it from others</li>

            User Testing Plan</h1> 
        <p class="intro"> Next, using the feedback we were given, we incorporated the changes into our 
            prototype and then conducted usability testing
            through the service <a class="hvr-underline-from-left" target="_blank" href = "https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting.com <i style = "font-size: 14px; color: white" class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
            Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to 
            complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes. The below table summarizes our the task we gave to our users, testing 
            instructions, and post-test questions.</p>

            For our tasks we tried to guide the users intuitively through the app. 
            We first had them find more info, then from that info, access specific 
            info (gas emissions), from there, we asked them to answer a question about
             that given data. For the most part, we were happy with our results! 
             Things were easy to read and information was clear for the users, and 
             despite varying speeds, everyone was able to successfully complete our tasks. <br><br><br></p>

            <h2>User 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Our first user was super speedy</li>
                <li>She had a little trouble clicking the buttons but it seemed like it was more of a hardware issue. </li>
                <li>She said things were easy to read and had little issue
                </li>
                <li>She did seem to get hung up on our red and green arrows next to the percentages for tenants, but that did not hurt her task performance</li>
            </ul>
       

            <h2><br> User 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User 2 took about twice as much time as the first user, but was only ~2 minutes behind user 3</li>
                <li>Navigation was largely intuitive until the last prompt, in which he struggled to find the tenants</li>
                <li>Things did not seem clearly labeled to him, and our consistent use of the same shades of red and green confused him into thinking that all numbers were related which was not true. This ended up adding a few minutes to the task</li>
                <li>He also was looking for some more visual information than we had provided in the form of graphs</li>
                <li>He recommended changing some color scheme choices so as to not imply improper relations between data

                <li>Was hoping for more tenant subdivisions of emissions use over time and time frames in general. </li>

        <h2> <br> Conclusion <br><br></h2>
        <p>Overall, the users were able to complete our tasks as expected, with none of them outright failing. They seemed to think that our design was
            readable and intuitive for the most part, but could have done with some more visual information/structure. Moving forward, we would add some more graphs and 
            we would provide the users with more dynamic data access so that they could find exactly what they were looking for in their own way. <br><br>
            This project was useful in developing the skills necessary to take an idea from conception to prototype. Often UI/UX designers have to
            take only an idea and turn in into a real product. The specifics of what the interface should look like is often
            left open-ended and the designer has to put themselves into the user's place to understand what they would want
            from the product if they were using it. It was great to get feedback on the original design and see how our team
            might have overlooked some flaws and ideas on how to improve it. It was also cool to use an external service to
            get user testing data and see actual users interact with our prototype.
